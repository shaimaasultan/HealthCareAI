# (1) HealthCare Diagnosis LLM AI Application
Health Care diagnosis LLM AI Application 

To visit your healthcare provider or Follow up 
Do we realy need website and s Form or two filling and adding appointment to your calender?

What if sending SMS really have a meaning other than just sending messages?
we can easly use the AI and LLM Genuse in lanaguage models in use in this application 
specially in rural place that do not have easy access for healthcare providers and may be more with follow ups encounters.
it deos not need to be even smart phone we only need to add one button to the phone orginal message application without the need to download any applications even.  

With SMS we can even use Emojis for some symptoms and users can click and send them it does not even need to be words in any langauage

Why; not any one can use LLM or AI with there own native langaue ? 
it does not need to be smart phone
it does not need to be website 
it can be easly normal phone with only SMS 
we do not need to rebuild models for each lanaguage separtly? we only need to map some lang terms to english and use this as translation Button in SMS application.
(translation already done decades ago) 
you do not need to have prompt or anything you can use you phone SMS application to ask about anything you need with your own langauge 
it does not need to be English you can use your own language and Hit translate and send? and the message will go to the LLM with English 
and the reposne will be also translated to your language 

I know there is already applications with similar functionalities; but most of these applications needs smart phones or advenced phone but this application does not.

Looking forward to see phones SMS original application uses AI actualy :).
